# Bolhadev.chat

Brazil has many talented developers, but unfortunately, fewer Brazilians speak English. This language barrier limits the world's ability to see our full potential.

English is a powerful tool for individuals to achieve their goals, granting access to a vast amount of content created in English. Proficiency in English is particularly important for developers seeking international opportunities.

The goal of this project is to create a safe and supportive environment for members of "BolhaDev" to practice and improve their communication skills.

## Tech

This project is designed to be cost-effective, ensuring it remains free for everyone.

One of the key features is the use of P2P (peer-to-peer) connections, allowing users to connect directly. This approach enables us to support numerous practice rooms running simultaneously without incurring significant server costs

## What's inside?

This repo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps

- `web`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app with the client code
- `server`: a [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) app to handle sockets and connect users

We are using:

- Turborepo
- Next
- Node
- Sockets
- WebRTC
- Tailwind
- Shadcn

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
